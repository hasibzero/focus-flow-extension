Focus Flow is a powerful browser extension for Google Chrome that helps you reclaim your time and attention by replacing distracting social media news feeds with clean, inspirational quotes. If you're looking to boost your productivity, reduce procrastination, and foster a healthier relationship with social media, this is the tool for you.

## 🎯 Why Focus Flow?

In a world full of digital noise, maintaining focus is a superpower. Social media feeds are engineered to be addictive, pulling you into endless scrolling and away from what truly matters.
